# lossless_compression_zoo
This repository contains a number of different lossless text compression algorithms implemented in Python.

## Main Contributors:
The project is for the final case study of a __Graduated Level Course: Online Algorithm__, and the original main contributors were (names in alphabetical order):
**Levi Guo (me), [Minghao Li](https://github.com/MingoLi), [Ye Yuan](https://github.com/LongWinter).**

## Dataset
The dataset was trasformed using Burrows-Wheeler text Transform (BWT) before passing to the data compression algorithm which offers a better input structure and time-and-space performances. ([link](https://github.com/nicolaprezza/BWTIL/tree/master/tools/dB-hash) for the BWT library)
