# lossless_compression_zoo
This repository contains a number of different lossless text compression algorithms implemented in Python.

## Main Contributors:
The project is a final case study for a __Graduated Level Course: Online Algorithm__, and the original main contributors were (names in alphabetical order):
**Levi Guo (me), [Minghao Li](https://github.com/MingoLi), [Ye Yuan](https://github.com/LongWinter).**

## Dataset
The dataset was trasformed using Burrows-Wheeler text Transform (BWT) before passing to the data compression algorithm which offers a better input structure and time-and-space performances. The BWT library that was applied is:

**BWTIL** : the BWT Text-indexing Library, see at https://github.com/nicolaprezza/BWTIL/tree/master/tools/dB-hash
